# Pichus-Super-Epic-Ripping-Kit
Hi yes welcome to my ripping kit, this is where I put resources for making SiIvaGunner-style high quality video game rips.
All my FLPs are made in whatever the current latest version of FL Studio is, so if you don't own a legal license, you will have to use the demo. The reason I don't make them for FL Studio 12 is because I don't want to encourage piracy, which could potentially get me in legal trouble.
I will also put other resources in here besides FLPs, such as song stems, edible video game music ripped straight from the game, and transcriptions of songs to use as a reference.
Enjoy!
