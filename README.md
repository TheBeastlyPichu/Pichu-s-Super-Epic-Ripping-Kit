# Pichus-Super-Epic-Ripping-Kit

Hi yes welcome to my ripping kit, this is where I put resources for making SiIvaGunner-style high quality video game rips.
My Sunsetter FLP requires FL Studio 20.8.0, and my Character Select - Street Fighter II FLP requires FL Studio 20.8.3. All other FLPs that I make (signified with "TheBeastlyPichu" in parentheses) should hopefully require only FL Studio 20.1.2.
I also have ripping software, edible game music, original music files, and stems in this ripping kit.
Enjoy!

(Some files were to large to be uploaded to Github, so I included a Google Drive link to them. If any of the links are down or you have another request for the ripping kit, DM me on Discord @TheBeastlyPichu#0512. I probably won't see any pull requests or issues cause I don't use GitHub often, so I recommend you just contact me on Discord.)
