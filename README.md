# Pichus-Super-Epic-Ripping-Kit
Hi yes welcome to my ripping kit, this is where I put resources for making SiIvaGunner-style high quality video game rips.
All my FLPs require the latest version of FL Studio as of making them.
I also have ripping software, edible game music, original music files, and stems in this ripping kit.
Enjoy!

(Some files were to large to be uploaded to Github, so I included a Google Drive link to them. If any of the links are down or you have another request for the ripping kit, DM me on Discord @TheBeastlyPichu#0512. I probably won't see any pull requests or issues cause I don't use GitHub often, so I recommend you just contact me on Discord.)
